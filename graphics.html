                <p class="w3-text-grey"> The figure below shows how the trip frequency of each plan holder changes with time. Monthly plans seem to average the largest
                mean trip frequency; however, walkup plans have the highest peak usage rates. For example, on <strong>October 10, 2016</strong>, there was a record <strong>1003</strong>
                trips, which after further researcher seemed to be a combination of the day being Columbus Day, and the baseball game between the LA Dodgers and Washington Nationals.

                    All plans display a right-skewed distribution, with monthly, annual, and walkup plans having increasingly great ride durations. It is interesting to note
                    that the majority of the area under the curves all reside behind the 30 minute duration mark, which may be correlated to Bikeshare's additional fee after
                    30 minutes of riding. Monthly, Annual, and Walkup holders pay $1.75, $1.75, and $3.50 per extra 30 minutes.

                <p class="w3-text-grey"> The figure below shows a plot of the top 40 locations of all starting and ending BikeShare stations. This X's on this graph
                    represent latitude and longitude coordinates, and their size/opacity represent how frequent the stations are used. The red dot on either plot
                    represents latitude/longitude coordinates of the mean station. The circles on the plots have a center equal to the mean lat/long coordinates,
                    and width/height equal to the mean standard dev of the lat/long coordinates. According to the enclosing circle, it is visually apparent that
                    the most popular starting stations are relatively close to the mean station compared to the ending stations; hence, why the ending stations'
                    enclosing circle is larger. This means rides are generally going from inner, closely located starting stations stations to outer, more spread
                    outer stations.
