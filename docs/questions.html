                    <h1>Commute Logistics</h1>
                    <p class="w3-text-grey"> According to <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2015/02/04/when-do-americans-leave-for-work/">this article regarding Commute hours</a>, L.A. morning commute hours are generally
                                             between 7 to 9 A.M. (inclusive). After assembling a pivot_table for weekdays and hourly counts, I found that <strong>16,887 riders</strong> use the bikes during morning hours.
                                             Evening commute hours generally range between 3 to 6 P.M (inclusive), and I found that <strong>17,926 riders</strong> use the bikes during these times. Although it is difficult to
                                             ascertain from this data that <strong>ALL</strong> riders from these time periods were specifically using the bikes to get to and from work, it makes sense after observing the figure to the left. Approaching
                                             morning commute hours, the mean number of riders jumps starkly, perhaps indicating many riders need the bikes for a purpose (commuting?); this suddenly drops after morning hours, and
                                             the same pattern follows for evening commute hours. Therefore, since the graphs agrees with human need, I think this interpretation of commuting riders is correct.
