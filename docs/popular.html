                    <h1>Stations Necessary to Restock Throughout Day</h1>
                    <p class="w3-text-grey"> A pivot_table was assembled to monitor the Station ID's which had the greatest loss and gain of bikes throughout the day. It is clear that for start stations, the greatest departing stations are stations
                                             <strong>3014, 3005, and 3030</strong> in the morning, and <strong>3069, 3030, and 3005</strong> in the evening. For ending stations, the greatest reception stations are <strong> 3031 and 3005 </strong> in the morning,
                                             and in the evening, <strong> 3031, 3069, and 3014</strong>. Since 3005 and 3030 stations are the large start stations in both the afternoon and evening, it is necessary, that between morning and evening
                                             bikes must be moved to these stations. These bikes could come from 3014 or 3069, whose max input of bikes climaxes at 4 and 12 P.M respectively. This would give transporters to send bikes during the ensuing
                                             start rush from 3 until 9 P.M. However, the greatest stockpile of bikes ends up collecting at station 3031; its max index is disproportionate. However, station 3031 climaxes at around 8 P.M. to 11P.M., so in order
                                             to replenish the lack of bikes in stations 3005 and 3030, bikes would have to be moved during the night to these stations for the next day.
